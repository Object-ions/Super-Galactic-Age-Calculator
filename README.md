# _Super Galactic Age Calculator_

#### By **Moshe Atia**

 This project is a simple JavaScript application that calculates a user's age based on different planet's solar years. The application includes functionalities such as returning the age in Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter years. Additionally, it calculates how many years have passed on each planet since a user's past birthday and determines how many years have yet to pass until a future birthday.
